# PRODIGE I: A 3000 au streamer feeding a Class I protostar

This repository collects all the data and code to replicate the results of the paper [Valdivia-Mena et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01023) (doi:10.1051/0004-6361/202243310).

- data/: includes all the data required to run the codes and replicate our results
- figures/: includes the figures that are in our paper, plus a couple more figures for free
- Data_figures.ipynb: notebook with all the code to make the figures included in the paper


This repository does not include the complete cubes, but cubes cut to a smaller
area. The complete cubes will be uploaded in the future by the PRODIGE collaboration.

This code uses the [velocity_tools package](https://github.com/jpinedaf/velocity_tools) from J. Pineda.

If you use any of the data or codes from your own work, please cite the original article!
